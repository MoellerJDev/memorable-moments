# Memorable Moments

## Overview
Memorable Moments is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application designed to create and manage a personalized collection of memories. This project includes a basic frontend and backend setup.

## Features

### Frontend (React)
- Home page displaying a list of memories.
- Upload page for adding new memories.
- Profile page for user information (placeholder functionality).
- Basic navigation using React Router.

### Backend (Node.js, Express)
- Basic server setup with Express.
- Placeholder API routes for memories and user profiles.
- Mongoose model definitions for Memory and User.
- Placeholder MongoDB connection setup.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (for database, setup is not complete)

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` in the frontend directory to start the React app.
4. Navigate to the backend directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Run `node server.js` in the backend directory to start the Express server.

## Future Enhancements
- Complete the MongoDB database integration.
- Implement user authentication and session management.
- Enhance frontend with better styling and responsiveness.
- Expand backend API with full CRUD operations for memories.
- Add image upload functionality with integration to external APIs (like Imgur).

## Note
This project is in its initial development phase and requires further implementation to be fully functional.
